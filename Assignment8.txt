Ready-to-run state:

A thread starts life in the Ready-to-run state 

Running state:

If a thread is in the Running state, it means that the thread is currently executing 

Dead state:

Once in this state, the thread cannot ever run again

Non-runnable states:

A running thread can transit to one of the non-runnable states, depending on the circumstances. A thread remains in a non-runnable state until a special transition occurs. A thread does not go directly to the Running state from a non-runnable state, but transits first to the Ready-to-run state.

The non-runnable states can be characterized as follows:

Sleeping: The thread sleeps for a specified amount of time .
Blocked for I/O: The thread waits for a blocking operation to complete .
Blocked for join completion: The thread awaits completion of another thread .
Waiting for notification: The thread awaits notification from another thread .
Blocked for lock acquisition: The thread waits to acquire the lock of an object .
